//notes
The docker push command is used to push a Docker image to a registry. Before you can push an image, you need to have an image locally that you want to push.

Assuming that you have an image named next-ai that you want to push to the Docker Hub registry under your username arun201 with a tagname of your choice, you can use the following command:

docker tag next-ai arun201/next-ai:tagname

This command will tag the next-ai image with the name arun201/next-ai:tagname. Replace tagname with the tag you want to use for the image.

After tagging the image, you can push it to the Docker Hub registry using the following command:

docker push arun201/next-ai:tagname

This command will push the arun201/next-ai:tagname image to the Docker Hub registry. Make sure you have logged in to Docker Hub using the docker login command before pushing the image.
//for push on hub

  1. docker login
